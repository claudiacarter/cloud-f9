## About this blog
I am an early career bioinformatician hoping to, through this blog, consolidate what I'm learning and to support others on a similar path. I'll be writing about:
- Bioinformatics and related topics such as statistics, computer science, machine learning
- Software development and releasing open source projects
- Reflections on my profession, development and career path
- Personal thoughts and opinions on the field

Note: all opinions are my own, not reflecting the Sanger Institute or any other organisation I am affiliated with

## Website Deployment and Development
Having zero web development experience I chose to deploy using Github Pages with Jekyll. I followed [this github skills course](https://github.com/skills/github-pages) to get a basic template up and running and will continue to develop and personalise it as I go.
